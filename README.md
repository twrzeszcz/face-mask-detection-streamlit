# General Info 
The goal of this project was to build a real time face mask detection app. For this purpose Tensorflow Object Detection API was used with a pretrained *MobileNetV2* model and the following dataset [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). Training process was done on the Google Colab according to the [Medium](https://medium.com/swlh/tensorflow-2-object-detection-api-with-google-colab-b2af171e81cc) article. In the **face_mask_detection_inference** notebook one can load the model and make some predictions on an image or in real time on the webcam. Streamlit application is written in the **app** file and is deployed here [Streamlit Face Mask Detection](https://share.streamlit.io/twrzeszcz/face-mask-detection-streamlit/main/app.py).
